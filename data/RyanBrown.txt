Through a project-based approach, students will work towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language. A successful student will become familiar with Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures.  A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary. Ryan has an average score of 60.0% in his work, which is equal to the grade of D-.

Ryan work ethic is really, really bad. The scale was originally supposed to be from 1 - 5 but Ryan Brown got a 0... Ryan does not colaborate at all. Hardly talks to peers or works with others The student has lacked/failed to show perserverence through the semester. This student doesn't come to see me after school, although this is still based on the needs of the student.I suggest that Ryan meet with me after school in order to boost his grade. 

He's a senior.
